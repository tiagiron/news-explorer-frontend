## Overview

This is my final project for the TripleTen Software Engineering Program. It utilizes a News API, "https://newsapi.org," to perform specialized search for recent news based on the keyword the user types in. Users can register an account, login, and save articles to their profiles to revisit. These saved articles can also be unsaved and removed from the user's profile which is hosted on a protected route. The layout is adaptive and works on larger screens, tablets, and iPhones.
